my setup scripts for newly installed Ubuntu OS

P.S.

- Setup script contains unreachable commands (because oh-my-zsh setup will terminate current bash process), I don't plan to resolve this issue. But unreachable to manually execute unreachable commands to complete setup script.
- Flatabulous theme is enabled via manually setup in unity tweak tool.

## Run

use command `sudo sh 14.04-setup.sh`

## Termination

`ctrl-c`

## TODO

- [ ] Ubuntu 18.04 x64 Setup script
